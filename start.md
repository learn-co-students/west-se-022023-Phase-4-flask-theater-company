# Example Videos

The following are the videos and solution for the live/remote program for 010923
Included with the videos are links to the worksheet given to students and the final solution code from that specific lecture.   
> Note: I often go back and clean up the solution code for students. There shouldnâ€™t be any major differences outside of the organization. I did a particularly poor job of keeping my demo code inline with my comments during the first lecture, but the solution code should be organized correctly.  - ix
